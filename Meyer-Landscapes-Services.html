            <p>We offer weekly lawn mowing as an exclusive seasonal contract, available only 
                to our current customers when combined with any of our other maintenance services.
                We no longer offer bi-weekly or one-time cuts, as we believe that consistent
                weekly mowing is essential for optimal lawn health. Mowing begins in early 
                May and continues through early November, coinciding with the growth cycle 
                before lawns enter dormancy.<br><br>
                What our lawn mowing service includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mow all lawn areas using commercial-grade mowers</li>
                    <li>Trim lawn edges</li>
                    <li>Blow off excess grass and clippings from walkways, patios, and driveways</li>
                </ul><br><br>
            <p>At Meyer Landscapes, we take great pride in delivering exceptional lawn care that
             fosters healthy, vibrant grass. To achieve the best possible results for both your 
             lawn and our services, we work closely with customers who share our dedication to 
             quality and care.<br><br>
             Here are some factors that we consider before entering into a seasonal agreement with any of our lawn mowing customers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Proper Hydration:</h6> An irrigation system is in place (or one is planned for installation this season) to ensure your lawn receives the necessary moisture to thrive all season long.</li><br>
                <li><h6>Targeted Treatments:</h6> A seasonal treatment plan, either self-managed or provided by one of the Cape's local fertilization specialists, is in place for overall lawn health and appearance.</li><br>
                <li><h6>Optimal Growth:</h6> Your lawn growth is consistent enough to warrant a weekly mow</li><br>
                <li><h6>Comprehensive Care:</h6> You utilize (or plan to utilize) Meyer Landscapes for at least one of our other landscape services.</li>
            </ul>
