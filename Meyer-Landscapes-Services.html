            <h1 class="text-success text-center">Professional Lawn Care & Mowing Services</h1>
            <p>We offer weekly lawn mowing as an exclusive seasonal contract, available only 
                to our current customers when combined with any of our other maintenance services.
                We no longer offer bi-weekly or one-time cuts, as we believe that consistent
                weekly mowing is essential for optimal lawn health. Mowing begins in early 
                May and continues through early November, coinciding with the growth cycle 
                before lawns enter dormancy.<br><br>
                What our lawn mowing service includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mow all lawn areas using commercial-grade mowers</li>
                    <li>Trim lawn edges</li>
                    <li>Blow off excess grass and clippings from walkways, patios, and driveways</li>
                </ul><br><br>
            <p>At Meyer Landscapes, we take great pride in delivering exceptional lawn care that
             fosters healthy, vibrant grass. To achieve the best possible results for both your 
             lawn and our services, we work closely with customers who share our dedication to 
             quality and care.<br><br>
             Here are some factors that we consider before entering into a seasonal agreement with any of our lawn mowing customers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Proper Hydration:</h6> An irrigation system is in place (or one is planned for installation this season) to ensure your lawn receives the necessary moisture to thrive all season long.</li><br>
                <li><h6>Targeted Treatments:</h6> A seasonal treatment plan, either self-managed or provided by one of the Cape's local fertilization specialists, is in place for overall lawn health and appearance.</li><br>
                <li><h6>Optimal Growth:</h6> Your lawn growth is consistent enough to warrant a weekly mow</li><br>
                <li><h6>Comprehensive Care:</h6> You utilize (or plan to utilize) Meyer Landscapes for at least one of our other landscape services.</li>
            </ul>

          <h5 class="text-success text-center">Seasonal Cleanups • Mulching • Pruning & Trimming • Weeding & Edging</h5>
          <p class="mt-2 pt-2">When it comes to your yard, we take its health and appearance very seriously. Yard maintenance requires attention throughout each 
            season, and it is not something that should just be done once a year. Check out our popular maintenance package options, catered 
            to work with any budget.

          <p class="mt-5 pt-2">What does a typical landscape season look like on Cape Cod?<br>We start the season with Spring cleanups, which
            focus on cleaning and weeding your planting beds as needed, and then re-edging the beds to prepare for mulch 
            (by request). It is also important that pruning or thinning of herbaceous plantings, as well as deadwood removal 
            be taken care of at this time. In the Spring, plants are coming out of dormancy and will respond very well to 
            this treatment. We finish your cleanup by dethatching all the lawn areas and blowing off any debris.<br><br> Mulching  
            follows shortly after the cleanup and is applied to all planting beds at a depth of no more than 2”, with extra 
            care taken to avoid “mulch mounding” around the base of plantings; this can cause rotting to occur. Regular 
            mulching of planting beds aids in moisture retention and keeps root systems cool and insulated during hot summer 
            months.<br>Throughout the Summer season (a.k.a. the “growing” season), a couple of visits are usually recommended 
            to perform regular pruning and trimming of plants, weeding, cleaning of beds, and checking on overall landscape 
            health.<br><br> Fall cleanups signify the season's end with removal of leaves and debris from all lawn and planting bed 
            areas, cleaning of first floor gutters as needed, and removal of deadwood from perennials. The start of this 
            service varies year-to-year depending on temperature and when the leaves begin to drop. On average, we begin at 
            the end of November. A good fall cleanup not only gets your property in shape and ready for winter, but also 
            eliminates damage caused by leaves left decaying upon lawn areas.
