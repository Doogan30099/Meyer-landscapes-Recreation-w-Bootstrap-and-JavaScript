        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Meyer Landscapes has been family owned and operated for over 15 years.
          Created in 2010 by Yarmouth residents Greg & Christine Meyer, the
          company became a proud member of the Cape Cod Landscape Association in
          2012. Greg is a graduate of the Massachusetts Stockbridge School of
          Agriculture, where he studied landscape design, contracting, and
          agriculture. Combining his education with over 25 years of work
          experience, Greg applies his extensive knowledge of the industry to
          every job that he works on. Christine is a graduate of Suffolk
          University with a Master's in Business Administration. Co-owner and
          Office Manager at Meyer Landscapes, Christine is usually the first
          person you will speak with when you call. With over 15 years in the
          Accounting and Bookkeeping industry before joining her husband at
          Meyer Landscapes, she brings an extra level of expertise and customer
          communication to the company. Greg and Christine were both born and
          raised on Cape Cod and have been married for nearly 15 years. They
          have a son together, who shares his father's passion for landscape
          equipment and “playing outside”. Greg and Christine have spent the
          last decade establishing trusted relationships with their customers
          and within their community.
